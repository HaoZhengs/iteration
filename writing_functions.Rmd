```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(25, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)

z_scores = function(x){
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)

y_vec = rnorm(40, mean = 12, sd = .3)

z_scores(x = y_vec)
```

How great is this?

Only kinda great.

Lets try again to update it.

```{r}
z_scores = function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x need to be numeric")
  }
  
  if(length(x) < 3){
    stop("x should contains at least three numbers")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}
```


```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x need to be numeric")
  }
  
  if(length(x) < 3){
    stop("x should contains at least three numbers")
  }
  
  mean_x = mean(x)
  sd_x = sd(x)
  
  output_df = 
    tibble(
      mean = mean_x,
      sd = sd_x
    )
  
  return(output_df)
  
}

mean_and_sd(x_vec)
mean_and_sd(y_vec)
```
